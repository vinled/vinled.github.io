Graduated in Advertising, i first had contact with development when i created a website in joomla, from then on i just went through many different things, such as:
-web design
-web master
-bits of js
-basics of phyton
but now im giving a try to swift and ios development.
I used to do a lot of design stuff, especially during my studies at the university and my plan is to create my first mobile app (which i don't what it is) and combine all my knowledge to one thing.

Thanks for reading!
